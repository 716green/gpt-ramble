  "I often have really great ideas while I'm driving but I can't jot them down. I notice that if I don't document these ideas immediately I lose them. I wonder if I've ever had an idea that could have changed the trajectory of my entire life if I had only remembered it. I think I need to find a solution for this problem. I'm a software developer, I could build something but the question is 'what do I build'? I think it might be a really good idea to build a progressive web app that has access to my microphone. I could create a manifest file so that it could be installed through the app store and then I could map it to a google assistant macro. If I were to do this, I could say 'Hey Google - remember this...', followed by this long incoherent rant about building this very app. Would it need to be able to be monetized? I suppose the time and energy it would save me, or the ideas that it would preserve would be value enough for me. It's also possible that the cost alone from GPT3 would be prohibitive to use it the way that I want to. I need to look into GPT3 pricing and figure out if this is a plausable idea. Ideally this app would be able to listen for a long period of time and then summarize the ideas back to me later.";
